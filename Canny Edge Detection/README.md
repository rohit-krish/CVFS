The Canny edge detection algorithm is composed of 6 steps:

1. Gray Scale conversion
2. Noise reduction
3. Gradient calculation
4. Non-maximum suppression
5. Double threshold
6. Edge Tracking by Hysteresis

Important thing to mention, is that the algorithm is based on grayscale pictures.
Therefore, the pre-requisite is to convert the image to grayscale before following the above-mentioned steps.
