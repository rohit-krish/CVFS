The Canny edge detection algorithm is composed of 5 steps:

1. Noise reduction
2. Gradient calculation
3. Non-maximum suppression
4. Double threshold
5. Edge Tracking by Hysteresis

Important thing to mention, is that the algorithm is based on grayscale pictures.
Therefore, the pre-requisite is to convert the image to grayscale before following the above-mentioned steps.
